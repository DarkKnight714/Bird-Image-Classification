# Bird Image Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify 525 bird species using machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes a dataset of bird images and follows a typical machine learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The model can recognize different bird species based on visual features extracted from the images.
